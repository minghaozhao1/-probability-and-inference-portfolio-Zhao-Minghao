In this assignment, we will perform a simulation to calculate the coverage probability of the 95% confidence interval of the median when computed from FÌ‚Xmle.

```{r}
library(stats4)
library(base)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
```
Coverage probability is an important operating characteristic of methods for constructing interval estimates, particularly confidence intervals.For the purposes of this deliverable, define the 95% confidence interval of the median to be the middle 95% of sampling distribution of the median. Similarly, the 95% confidence interval of the mean, standard deviation, etc. is the middle 95% of the respective sampling distribution. define the coverage probability as the long run proportion of intervals that capture the population parameter of interest. Conceptualy, one can calculate the coverage probability with the following steps

1. generate a sample of size N from a known distribution
2. construct a confidence interval
3. determine if the confidence captures the population parameter
4. Repeat steps (1) - (3) many times. Estimate the coverage probability as the proportion of samples for which the confidence interval captured the population parameter.

In the following setp, we used sample size 201 with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 to generate a sample data. We can see from the code, we used MLE to estimate our mean and standard deviation for the distribution. 
```{r}
set.seed(3)
sampledis=c(201,0,1)

generate_data <- function(parameter){ 
  # Hard coded standard normal distribution
  rnorm(parameter[1],mean=parameter[2],sd=parameter[3]) 
}


estimation.mle <- function(data) {
  nmean=mean(data)
  nsd=sd(data)
  nLL <- function(mean, sd){
  fs <- dnorm(
        x = data
      , mean 
      , sd 
      , log = TRUE
    ) 
  -sum(fs)
}
fit <- mle(
    minuslogl =nLL
  , start = list(mean = nmean, sd = nsd))
  mle.mean=coef(fit)[1]
  mle.sd=coef(fit)[2]
  return(c(length(data),mle.mean,mle.sd))
}
data = sampledis %>% generate_data
mean=mean(data)
sd=sd(data)
estimatedMLE<- data%>%  estimation.mle()
estimatedMLE
hist(data,freq = FALSE)
curve(dnorm(x,mean=mean,sd=sd),add=TRUE)

```

We used MLE to estimated the mean and standard deviation. 

We need to define the sampling distribution function. For the coverage interval, the lower confidence limit is 2.5% and the upper confidence limit is 97.5%. We will run 5000 times of simulation by using our estimated MLE mean and standard deviation to find the median. 
```{r}
boot_ci <- function(parameter1){
  # Hard coded number of draws
  R <- 5000
  
  sampdist <- rep(NA, R)
  for(i in 1:R){
    
    sampdist[i] <- parameter1 %>% generate_data %>% median
  }
  # Hard coded symmetric density interval
  quantile(sampdist, c(0.025, 0.975))
}
capture_median <- function(ci){
  # Hard coded 0 as parameter of interest
  1*(ci[1] < 0 & 0 < ci[2])
}
quantile <- estimatedMLE%>%  boot_ci 
quantile
quantile%>% capture_median
```
the code will return a 1 if the captured the population parameter of interest, return a 0 if it is not. 

The figure below shows the 95% confidence interval calculated for a handful of samples. Intervals in blue capture the population parameter of interest; intervals in red do not.
```{r}

knitr::include_graphics('1.png')
```

Idealy, a 95% confidence interval will capture the population parameter of interest in 95% of samples.

We repeat above steps for 1000 times. 
```{r message=F , warning=F}
M <- 1000 # Make small, we are still testing the code
captures <- rep(NA, M)
for(i in 1:M){
  captures[i] <- 
    sampledis %>% generate_data %>% estimation.mle%>%  boot_ci %>% capture_median
}
capture_prob <- mean(captures)
capture_prob
```
The coverage probability for 1000 times simulations is 0.976. By definition, a 95% will be effective, our result is higher than the standard. 

I might change the simulation to learn more about the operating characteristics by selecting alternative distribution. For example, I will use change the iteration of the simulation. Right now it is runs 1000 times to generate the result. By adding more times to the simulation, we could get a more precise result.
